# My fork of ["Essential Effects Code"](https://github.com/inner-product/essential-effects-code)

This repository is a fork of
[https://github.com/inner-product/essential-effects-code](https://github.com/inner-product/essential-effects-code). It contains the examples implemented with CE2 as well as with CE3 in different sbt sub projects.

## Using the Source Code

You will need to have Git, the JDK, and an internet connection to run the exercises.
All other dependencies are either included with the repo
or downloaded on demand during compilation.

## Notes on Editors and IDEs

If you don't have a particular preference for a Scala editor or IDE,
we recommend you do the exercises for this course using
the [Visual Studio Code][vscode] editor with the [Metals][metals] and [Scala syntax][scala-syntax] extensions.

If you want to use IntelliJ we suggest installing it via the [Scala Bundle][intellij-scala-bundle],
which includes all the plugins you need for Scala development.
